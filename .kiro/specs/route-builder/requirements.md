# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The route builder app is an intelligent cycling route generation tool that automatically creates optimized cycling routes based on user inputs. Users specify their starting point, destination, ride type (road or gravel), desired length, elevation preferences, and points of interest. The system leverages data from popular cycling platforms like Strava, Komoot, and RideWithGPS to analyze heatmaps and identify the best cycling routes. The output is a GPX file with a visual preview, ready for use on GPS devices or cycling apps.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cyclist, I want to input my route preferences (start/end points, ride type, length, elevation), so that the system can generate an optimized cycling route automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the route builder THEN the system SHALL display input fields for starting and ending locations
2. WHEN a user enters locations THEN the system SHALL validate and geocode the addresses or coordinates
3. WHEN setting preferences THEN the system SHALL provide options for ride type (road or gravel)
4. WHEN specifying route parameters THEN the system SHALL allow setting desired distance range
5. IF a user sets elevation preferences THEN the system SHALL accept options for flat, moderate, or challenging elevation profiles
6. WHEN all inputs are provided THEN the system SHALL enable route generation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cyclist planning a ride, I want to specify points of interest (bakeries, restaurants, cafes) with custom break distances, so that my route includes planned stops at my preferred intervals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up a route THEN the system SHALL provide POI category selection (bakery, restaurant, cafe, bike shop, viewpoint, etc.)
2. WHEN selecting POI categories THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify the distance interval for each type of break
3. WHEN distance intervals are set THEN the system SHALL place POIs approximately at those distances along the route
4. WHEN points of interest are selected THEN the system SHALL query current opening hours and availability
5. WHEN incorporating POIs THEN the system SHALL only include locations that will be open during estimated arrival times
6. IF opening hours are unavailable THEN the system SHALL flag uncertain availability to the user
7. WHEN multiple POI types are requested THEN the system SHALL distribute them according to user-specified break intervals
8. IF no suitable POI exists at the specified distance THEN the system SHALL suggest the nearest alternative within a reasonable range

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a route generation system, I want to leverage cycling platform data (Strava, Komoot, RideWithGPS), so that I can create routes using proven popular cycling paths and heatmap data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating routes THEN the system SHALL integrate with Strava heatmap data to identify popular cycling segments
2. WHEN analyzing route options THEN the system SHALL query Komoot for route recommendations and surface type data
3. WHEN optimizing routes THEN the system SHALL use RideWithGPS data for elevation profiles and route quality metrics
4. IF multiple platform data conflicts THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on ride type and user preferences
5. WHEN platforms are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to alternative routing algorithms
6. WHEN using platform data THEN the system SHALL respect API rate limits and terms of service

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cyclist, I want to receive a GPX file with my generated route, so that I can import it into my GPS device or cycling app for navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN route generation is complete THEN the system SHALL create a properly formatted GPX file
2. WHEN generating GPX THEN the system SHALL include all waypoints, track points, and route metadata
3. WHEN creating the file THEN the system SHALL embed route name, description, and generation timestamp
4. IF points of interest are included THEN the system SHALL add them as waypoints with descriptions
5. WHEN GPX is ready THEN the system SHALL provide immediate download option
6. WHEN downloading THEN the system SHALL use descriptive filename with route details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cyclist reviewing a generated route, I want to see a visual preview with key metrics, so that I can evaluate the route before downloading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a route is generated THEN the system SHALL display an interactive map preview
2. WHEN showing the preview THEN the system SHALL highlight the route path with different colors for surface types
3. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL show total distance, elevation gain/loss, and estimated time
4. IF points of interest are included THEN the system SHALL mark them clearly on the map preview
5. WHEN viewing elevation THEN the system SHALL provide an elevation profile chart
6. WHEN preview is shown THEN the system SHALL allow zooming and panning to inspect route details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cyclist with specific needs, I want the system to optimize routes based on my ride type preferences, so that road cyclists get smooth paved routes and gravel cyclists get appropriate off-road paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ride type is "road" THEN the system SHALL prioritize paved roads and bike paths
2. WHEN ride type is "gravel" THEN the system SHALL include unpaved roads, trails, and gravel paths
3. WHEN optimizing for road cycling THEN the system SHALL avoid steep gradients and high-traffic roads where possible
4. WHEN optimizing for gravel cycling THEN the system SHALL include scenic routes and natural terrain
5. IF surface data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL make conservative assumptions based on road classification
6. WHEN route type conflicts with distance requirements THEN the system SHALL notify user of compromises

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a cyclist planning timed rides, I want the system to consider opening hours of points of interest, so that I don't arrive at closed locations during my ride.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating arrival times THEN the system SHALL estimate based on distance, elevation, and average cycling speeds
2. WHEN checking POI availability THEN the system SHALL query current opening hours from reliable sources
3. WHEN POI will be closed THEN the system SHALL either exclude it or suggest alternative timing
4. IF opening hours change seasonally THEN the system SHALL use current season data
5. WHEN multiple POIs are requested THEN the system SHALL optimize the route order for maximum accessibility
6. WHEN opening hours are uncertain THEN the system SHALL warn the user and provide contact information
